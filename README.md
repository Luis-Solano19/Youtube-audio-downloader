# Youtube-audio-downloader
A simple audio downloader for youtube videos.

Needs to have installed "ffmpeg" and the bin folder on enviroments variables. Maybe this tool can be packaged along with the app when creating an executable using pyinstaller but haven't tried yet. It is simple, you give a youtube link, it begins the donwload, converts audio from  webm to mp3 then saves the file in downloads folder
